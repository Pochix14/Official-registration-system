# Welcome to Registration System
System created in order to keep track of company officials.

Developed in Java and connected to SQL Server.

Basically each official only has to pass his card (barcode) in the reader and the system automatically marks the entrance or exit, as appropriate.
Also mark the time worked, overtime worked and if there was a late arrival.

In the report option, it can be generated by name, ID, department, conservation area, specific date, date range or complete report.
Once the report is generated, the options are given to send by mail or print.

In the menu bar there is an options panel in case a user has to be added, modified or deleted. Also with a help panel that shows the instructions according to the corresponding need; as well as the credits.
